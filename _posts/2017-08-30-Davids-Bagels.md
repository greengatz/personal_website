David's Bagels at 16th and 1st

New York is known for its bagels. My first time eating them was definitely good; visually they were different than those back home. I'm used uniform, circular bagels with a clear hole in the center. What I saw here was almost bulbousy, some parts taller than others, and the hole was virtually nonexistant. Almost similar to a roll.

It should also be noted that there wasn't much of a flavor variety. Salt, Onion, Everything; standard bagel options, but no cheese varieties like Asiago or Jalapeno Cheddar.

Flavorwise though, how does it hold up? Well I got a Western Omelate on a Plain bagel. The western omelate was onion, green bell pepper, tomato, and eggs. Something interesting is that the omelate was cooked on a grill and not in a microwave; also adding to the uneven shaping of the bagel. It was tasty. The omelate filling was exactly what you would expect from the ingredients, but the bagel itself was pretty impressive. It's flavor came off slightly doughy, which I enjoyed, and the the egg wash on the top gave it a little shine and flavor that I wasn't expecting.

As for value; it seemed fine but nothing special. That bagel sandwich, a coffee, and an orange juice carton cost $6.50 before tax, and it was pretty massive breakfast. I would suggest maybe getting just an egg and butter sandwich at $4.50 for breakfast because that should still be plenty of food.

Would I go there again? Yes, but I've got too many other places to check out to settle on the first bagel shop I eat at in New York City.
